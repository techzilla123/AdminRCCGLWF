# Deployment Note

## About the 403 Deployment Error

You may see this error during deployment:
```
Error while deploying: XHR for "/api/integrations/supabase/pi6jrziXOuIDA41ASJC5Yc/edge_functions/make-server/deploy" failed with status 403
```

### What This Means

This is a **deployment system notification**, not a critical application error. The error occurs because:

1. The Figma Make deployment system is looking for a function named `make-server`
2. Your actual function is named `make-server-c28f50fa` (with a unique identifier)
3. The deployment system may be using cached information or a generic function name pattern

### Is This a Problem?

**No, this can be safely ignored if:**

✅ Your application is loading and functioning correctly
✅ You can log in and access all features
✅ Data is being saved to Supabase
✅ API calls are working (check browser console for any real errors)

### How to Verify Everything Works

1. **Check Browser Console**: 
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look at the Console tab
   - API calls should succeed (200 status codes)
   - You should see successful responses from `make-server-c28f50fa`

2. **Test Key Features**:
   - Login/Logout works
   - Can add/edit/delete members
   - Can create events
   - Can record donations
   - All modals open and save correctly

3. **Check Supabase Function Logs**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Edge Functions
   - Check if `make-server-c28f50fa` function exists
   - View the function logs to see if requests are being processed

### If You Need to Redeploy

The function code is located in:
```
/supabase/functions/make-server-c28f50fa/
```

This directory contains:
- `index.tsx` - Main server code with all API endpoints
- `kv_store.tsx` - Database interface for storing data

### Real Errors to Watch For

Pay attention to these errors instead:
- ❌ "Unauthorized" errors when using the app
- ❌ "Failed to fetch" errors in the console
- ❌ Data not saving to the database
- ❌ Login not working
- ❌ 500/404 errors from API calls

### Technical Background

The deployment system might be:
- Using a generic function name pattern
- Looking in the wrong directory (old `server` directory vs new `make-server-c28f50fa`)
- Experiencing a temporary permissions issue
- Trying to deploy a function that doesn't need redeployment

As long as your application works correctly, this deployment warning can be ignored.
