# Settings and Recent Fixes Implementation

## Date: October 17, 2025

This document outlines the comprehensive fixes and improvements made to the church management system, particularly focusing on Settings functionality, user management, and various bug fixes.

---

## 1. Image Upload Size Increase ✅

**Problem**: Image uploads were limited to 5MB, which was too restrictive.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ImageUpload.tsx` to accept files up to 10MB
- Updated server-side storage bucket configuration to allow 10MB files
- Updated user-facing messaging to reflect new 10MB limit

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/ImageUpload.tsx` (lines 34-36, 166-168)
- `/supabase/functions/make-server-c28f50fa/index.tsx` (line 27)

---

## 2. Settings Functionality Implementation ✅

**Problem**: Settings page had no backend integration - all data was static and nothing saved to the database.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive settings management system with full CRUD operations:

### Backend API Endpoints Added:
- `GET /settings` - Retrieve church settings
- `PUT /settings` - Update church settings

### Features Implemented:
1. **Church Information Management**
   - Church Name, Pastor Name
   - Address, Phone, Email, Website
   - Persistent storage in Supabase

2. **Notification Settings**
   - Email Notifications toggle
   - New Member Notifications
   - Donation Notifications
   - Event Notifications
   - All settings saved to database

3. **System Settings**
   - Timezone configuration
   - Date format preferences
   - Automatic backup toggle
   - Member portal toggle

**Files Modified/Created**:
- `/components/Settings.tsx` (completely rewritten with state management)
- `/utils/api.ts` (added settingsAPI methods)
- `/supabase/functions/make-server-c28f50fa/index.tsx` (added settings endpoints)

---

## 3. User Management System ✅

**Problem**: No way to manage users, add new users, or control permissions.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive user management system with role-based access control.

### Super Admin Features:
Only the account `admin@rccglivingwordforney.com` can:
- View all system users
- Create new users with custom roles
- Edit existing users (name, role, password)
- Delete users (except super admin)
- Assign admin privileges to other users

### Backend API Endpoints Added:
- `GET /users` - List all users (super admin only)
- `POST /users` - Create new user (super admin only)
- `PUT /users/:id` - Update user (super admin only)
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user (super admin only)
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info with role

### User Roles Available:
- **Admin** - Full system access
- **Staff Member** - Staff-level permissions
- **Volunteer** - Volunteer-level permissions
- **Member** - Basic member permissions

### Security Features:
1. Super admin account cannot be deleted
2. Only super admin can access user management
3. All user operations require authentication
4. Password updates are optional when editing users

**Files Modified/Created**:
- `/components/Settings.tsx` (added user management UI)
- `/utils/api.ts` (added usersAPI methods)
- `/supabase/functions/make-server-c28f50fa/index.tsx` (added user management endpoints)
- `/App.tsx` (added currentUserEmail state tracking)

## 4. Admin Account Setup

### Initial Setup:
When first setting up the system:
1. Use the "Setup Admin" page
2. **IMPORTANT**: Create admin with:
   - Email: `admin@rccglivingwordforney.com`
   - Password: `admin`
3. This account becomes the super admin with full user management capabilities

### User Management Access:
- Only `admin@rccglivingwordforney.com` can access the User Management section
- This section appears in Settings only for the super admin
- Other users will not see user management options

---

## 5. Loading State Improvements

**Problem**: Random preloader appearing unexpectedly.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper loading states throughout Settings component
- Loading spinner only shows during:
  - Initial data fetch
  - Saving operations
  - User management operations
- All async operations properly handle loading states

---

## 6. Database Integration

All settings and user data now properly persist to Supabase:

### KV Store (Settings):
- Church information
- Notification preferences
- System settings

### Supabase Auth (Users):
- User accounts
- User metadata (name, role)
- Authentication tokens
- Last sign-in tracking

---

## Usage Guide

### For Super Admin:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   ```
   Email: admin@rccglivingwordforney.com
   Password: admin
   ```

2. **Managing Settings**:
   - Navigate to Settings page
   - Update any church information
   - Click "Save" buttons to persist changes
   - Changes are immediately saved to database

3. **Managing Users**:
   - Navigate to Settings page
   - Scroll to "User Management" section
   - Click "Add User" to create new accounts
   - Use Edit button to update user info or reset passwords
   - Use Delete button to remove user access

### For Regular Users:
- Can view and update church information
- Can update notification preferences
- Can update system settings
- Cannot access user management

## API Reference

### Settings API (`settingsAPI`)
```typescript
// Get settings
await settingsAPI.get();

// Update settings
await settingsAPI.update({
  churchName: 'New Name',
  pastorName: 'Pastor Name',
  // ... other settings
});
```

### Users API (`usersAPI`)
```typescript
// Get all users (super admin only)
await usersAPI.getAll();

// Create user (super admin only)
await usersAPI.add({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password123',
  name: 'John Doe',
  role: 'member'
});

// Update user (super admin only)
await usersAPI.update(userId, {
  name: 'New Name',
  role: 'admin',
  password: 'newpassword' // optional
});

// Delete user (super admin only)
await usersAPI.delete(userId);

// Get current user info
await usersAPI.getCurrentUser();
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Super Admin Protection**: The super admin account cannot be deleted through the UI
2. **Role-Based Access**: User management is restricted to super admin only
3. **Authentication Required**: All API endpoints require valid access token
4. **Password Security**: Passwords are only required when creating users or explicitly updating them
