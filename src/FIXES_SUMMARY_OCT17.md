### 2. ‚úÖ Random Preloader Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Loading spinner appearing randomly or stuck on screen.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper loading state management in Settings component
- Each async operation has its own try-catch with loading states
- Loading only shows during actual data fetches
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks

**Files Updated**:
- `/components/Settings.tsx` - Added proper isLoading state management

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Settings Not Saving to Database

**Problem**: All settings were hardcoded, no backend integration.

**Solution**: Full backend implementation with database persistence.

**Backend Endpoints Added**:
```
GET  /make-server-c28f50fa/settings     - Get settings
PUT  /make-server-c28f50fa/settings     - Update settings
```

**Features Implemented**:
- Church Information (name, pastor, address, phone, email, website)
- Notification Settings (toggles for different notification types)
- System Settings (timezone, date format, backups, member portal)
- Real-time save with toast feedback
- Default settings if none exist

**Files Created/Updated**:
- `/utils/api.ts` - Added `settingsAPI`
- `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` - Added settings endpoints
- `/supabase/functions/make-server-c28f50fa/index.tsx` - Added settings endpoints
- `/components/Settings.tsx` - Complete rewrite with state management

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Super Admin System & User Management

**Problem**: No way to manage users or control who has admin access.

**Solution**: Comprehensive user management system with role-based access.

**Super Admin Account**:
```
Email: admin@rccglivingwordforney.com
Password: admin
```

**Only this account can**:
- View all system users
- Create new users
- Edit user roles (make admins)
- Delete users
- Reset user passwords

**Backend Endpoints Added**:
```
GET    /make-server-c28f50fa/users        - List all users (super admin only)
POST   /make-server-c28f50fa/users        - Create user (super admin only)
PUT    /make-server-c28f50fa/users/:id    - Update user (super admin only)
DELETE /make-server-c28f50fa/users/:id    - Delete user (super admin only)
GET    /make-server-c28f50fa/auth/me      - Get current user info
```

**User Roles**:
- Administrator
- Staff Member
- Volunteer
- Member

**Security Features**:
- Super admin account cannot be deleted
- Only super admin email can access user management
- All operations require authentication
- 403 Forbidden for non-super admin attempts

**Files Updated**:
- `/utils/api.ts` - Added `usersAPI`
- `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` - Added user management endpoints
- `/supabase/functions/make-server-c28f50fa/index.tsx` - Added user management endpoints
- `/components/Settings.tsx` - Added User Management UI section
- `/App.tsx` - Added currentUserEmail tracking

### 5. ‚úÖ 404 Error Resolution

**Problem**: 
```
Error response: 404 Not Found
Error loading data: Error: Request failed with status 404
```

**Root Cause**: New endpoints were only added to one server file.

**Solution**: 
- Added all new endpoints to `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`
- Added error handling fallbacks in Settings component
- Both server files now have identical endpoint implementations

**Files Updated**:
- `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` - Added missing endpoints
- `/components/Settings.tsx` - Added fallback error handling
